## Code Guidelines & Standards

### Backend (Django REST Framework)
- **Style Standard**: Follow [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) style guidelines.
- **Abstract Models**: Subclass `common.models.BaseModel` to ensure automatic `created_at`, `updated_at`, and soft delete capabilities.
- **API Formatting**: Ensure all responses return through standard DRF serializers or utilize `PurniaJSONRenderer` format:
  ```json
  {
    "success": true,
    "message": "Operation description",
    "data": { ... }
  }
  ```
- **Migrations**: Always run `python manage.py makemigrations` and ensure migrations apply without conflicts (`python manage.py migrate`).

### Frontend (React 19 + Vite + Tailwind CSS v4)
- **Components**: Write clean, modular functional components in `.jsx`.
- **Styling**: Use utility-first classes with Tailwind CSS v4. Avoid inline custom CSS styles unless required for dynamic calculations.
- **Linting & Code Quality**: Run `npm run lint` (using Oxlint) before committing code.
- **Services & Fallback**: When adding new API services to `src/services/apiService.js`, update `src/services/mockData.js` so the frontend remains fully functional in offline demo mode.
